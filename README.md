# disturbancesmlx on Bluesky

A bot that publishes Lisbon Metro service disruptions on Bluesky, based on data from the [UnderLX API](https://developer.underlx.com/api/), which in turn integrates data from the Lisbon Metro API.

See it in action at [@perturbacoes.pt](https://bsky.app/profile/perturbacoes.pt).

The data can be seen over at [perturbacoes.pt](https://perturbacoes.pt/) too.

We're not too proud of the code as it is right now, but this was put together in three hours by someone who had no previous experience interacting with the AT protocol or anything else Bluesky. It worksâ„¢ (maybe).
